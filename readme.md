This is a 4th self-made project after finishing a 100 days of code course.
It's idea is to be able to add watermark to any image that the user has provided (both using the url and opened from a computer path)
I used Tkinter and Pillow and additionally tkmacosx for Buttons as they were not appearing correctly for me using tk.Buttons (I'm working on mac)
All requirements are attached. 

If anyone would have any suggestions for the code I would much appreciate the tips.
